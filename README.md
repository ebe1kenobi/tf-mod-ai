# AI Native mod

When activated by the option **--nativeaimod** (and optionnaly **--nativeaimodnokeyboard** if you want to play against up to 7 AI), the archer select screen will give you the choice to select one or multiple AI with the key 1 to 8. The AI are control like a keyboard, so each AI has a keyboard configuration (See [AI Keyboard Configuration](#aikeyboardconfiguration)

It's a bit dumb (the AI in the AI python mod is better, dumb too but better :) )

The Quest and Darkworld are not implemented yet.
